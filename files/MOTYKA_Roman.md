## Abstract

Dr. Roman Motyka is an Emeritus Research Professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and an Affiliate Faculty with the University of Alaska Southeast in Juneau. Dr. Motyka has conducted pioneering research on the study of surging glacier dynamics, post-Little Ice Age glacial isostatic adjustment, and lake-calving / tidewater glaciers. Dr. Motyka has also led research programs on the Mendenhall Glacier, the destination of our Thursday excursion. To help us prepare for our trip, Dr. Motyka will provide us with an overview of the climate, mass balance and dynamics of Mendenhall and the surrounding glaciers of southest Alaska.
