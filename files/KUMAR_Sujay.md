## Title: Quantifying multidecadal hydrological changes over HMA 

## Presenter: Sujay V. Kumar

## Abstract:

This project utilizes the capabilities of the NASA Land Information System ([LIS](http://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov)) and the NASA Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NUWRF) systems to quantify hydrologic and cryospheric changes and their primary drivers in the past 30+ years over the High Mountain Asia (HMA) region. Using modeling and data assimilation capabilities in LIS, the project will develop characterization of the changes in snow and ice by incorporating information from passive microwave satellite measurements with land surface model simulations through a comprehensive analysis. The assimilation will directly employ passive microwave radiance measurements through machine learning based forward models. The NUWRF system will be used to quantify and understand the impact of changes in snow and glaciers on elevation dependent warming on land-atmosphere feedbacks. The model outputs and forecasts produced through the project will be utilized for the characterization of water resources vulnerabilities and risks in the HMA region.  Early results from the land surface simulations at 1km resolution and the updates from the machine learning forward model development will be presented.
