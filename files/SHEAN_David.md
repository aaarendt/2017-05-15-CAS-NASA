## Title:  High resolution Digital Elevation Models for High Mountain Asia derived from commerical stereo image pairs 

## Presenters: David Shean

## Abstract:

We generated approximately 1300 high-resolution (2 meter) DEMs from commercial stereo image pairs acquired over HMA glaciers from 2010 to present.  We are creating a regional high-resolution DEM mosaic and dense time series for elevation change analysis on decadal to seasonal timescales.  Preliminary ~15-year (2000 to ~2015) geodetic mass balance estimates for 17000 glaciers show positive trends in the Karakoram and negative trends for the Himalayas.
